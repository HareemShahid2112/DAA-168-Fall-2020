## N-Queen Problem Solution by Backtracking Algorithm ##
N Queens Problem is a famous puzzle in which n-queens are to be placed on an nxn chessboard such that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal. In this algorithm, I  have implemented a 4*4 matrix to place 4 queens. 

Time Complexity in N-Queen= O(n!).
## RECURSIVE BACKTRACKING ALGO ##
Backtracking is an algorithmic-procedure for tackling issues recursively by attempting to manufacture an answer gradually, each piece in turn, eliminating those arrangements that neglect to fulfill the correct arrangement.

## N-Queen Problem Solution by Backtracking Algorithm ##
## RECURSIVE BACKTRACKING ALGO ##
Backtracking is an algorithmic-procedure for tackling issues recursively by attempting to manufacture an answer gradually, each piece in turn, eliminating those arrangements that neglect to fulfill the correct arrangement.

Time Complexity in N-Queen= O(n!).
